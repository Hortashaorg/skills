## Zero Context Provider - Code Review & Onboarding
- Review zero-provider architecture and folder structure
- Understand auth state management flow
- Review ZeroFactory and instance creation logic
- Understand initialization sequence (refresh → code detection → login)
- Review error handling and edge cases
- Ensure code is maintainable and well-documented

## Zero Context Provider - Missing Features
- Re-create Zero instance when auth state changes (after login)
- Add logout functionality
- Test Zero queries with useQuery() in components
- Test Zero mutations and UI reactivity
- Build real-world component (list + form) to stress-test
- Handle Zero instance updates reactively
- Test multiple components using Zero simultaneously

## Backend & Permissions
- Support logout endpoint (clear refresh token cookie)



- is schema.ts needed in the database package?
- i prefer getters in the environment.ts file.
